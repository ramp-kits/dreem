# Dreem RAMP starting kit

_Author: Lucy Liu_

This challenge was adapted from the 'Predict brain deep sleep slow oscillation'
challenge on [Challenge data](https://challengedata.ens.fr/challenges/10).

The Dreem headband is a device that uses three kind of sensors: EEG electrodes,
accelerometer and pulseoximeter to measure sleep. The aim of this challenge is
to use EEG signals acquired on the Dreem headband to predict slow oscillation
deep sleep.

#### Set up

Open a terminal and

1. install the `ramp-workflow` library (if not already done)
  ```
  $ pip install git+https://github.com/paris-saclay-cds/ramp-workflow.git
  ```
  
2. Follow the ramp-kits instructions from the [wiki](https://github.com/paris-saclay-cds/ramp-workflow/wiki/Getting-started-with-a-ramp-kit)

#### Local notebook

Get started on this RAMP with the [dedicated notebook](Dreem_starting_kit.ipynb).

To test the starting-kit, run


```
ramp_test_submission 
```


#### Help
