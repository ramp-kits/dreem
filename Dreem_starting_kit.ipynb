    "### Measuring Sleep\n",
    "\n",
    "The measurment of sleep is usually done in a sleep laboratory. Various electrodes are attached to the head to measure physiological signals. Electrical activity in the brain is measured by electroencephalography (EEG). Muscle activity is recorded using electromyography (EMG), because muscle tone also differs between wakefulness and sleep. Eye movements during sleep are measured using electro-oculography (EOG). Other sensors can be added (pulseoxymeter, airflow etc.) These procedure is called polysomnographie (PSG) and allows to analyse the state of the patient during sleep. It also allows to track sleep related disease such as sleep apnea or restless-leg syndrom.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dreem Headband\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Dreem headband](https://dreem.com/en/) is a device able to measure sleep at home. It is easy to use and more comfortable than a classic PSG. Its aims to help people track and improve their sleep. The Dreem headband uses three kind of sensors: EEG electrodes, accelerometer and pulseoximeter. Hence, it is able to measure brain activity, position, respiration, heartrate and movement all through the night. The device is also able to send sounds using bone conduction. Signals are analyzed online throughout the night and the device is able to perform sound stimulation to enhance deep sleep quality at different steps of the night: falling asleep, deep sleep and awakening. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Normal sleep\n",
    "\n",
    "Sleep progresses in cycles that involve multiple sleep stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* wake\n",
    "* light sleep (non-REM stage 1 and 2)\n",
    "* deep sleep (non-REM stage 3)\n",
    "* REM sleep\n",
    "\n",
    "Different sleep stages are associated with different physiological functions. The represenation of the sleep stages through the night is called an hypnogram (example shown below) and is built from the physiological signals recorded by PSG and analyzed by window of 30seconds. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deep Sleep\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep sleep (also called slow wave sleep) occurs mainly in the first hours of sleep. It is associated with memory consolidation, energy restoration, hormone releasing. Electroencephalographic measurement in deep sleep is characterized by slow oscillations: trains of high magnitude and low frequency waves (1-4 Hz).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deep sleep enhancement\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Sleep can be enhanced by inducing slow oscillations through various kind of stimulations (auditory, visual, magnetic etc. see this publication). The Dreem headband is able to perform such sound stimulation during deep sleep.\n",

    "## Aim of challenge\n",
    "In this challenge, data consists of EEG signals acquired on the Dreem headband in sham condition i.e. without any kind of sound stimulations, 'normal condition'.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this dataset, we try to predict whether or not a slow oscillation will be followed by another one in sham condition (without any stimulation). This will allow us to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Predict normal brain activity\n",
    "* Know when it’s interesting to stimulate\n",
    "* Better quantify the impact of an individual stimulation by comparing to what would have occurred without stimulation\n",
    "\n",
    "The metric used to assess the model predictions is the [sk-learn accuracy score](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score.html#sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score) - which returns the fraction of correctly classified samples."

You can check the starting-kit ([`feature_extractor.py`](/edit/submissions/starting_kit/feature_extractor.py) and [`classifier.py`](/edit/submissions/starting_kit/classifier.py)) for an example. The submission is trained and tested on our backend in a similar way as `ramp_test_submission` does locally. While your submission is waiting in the queue and being trained, you can find it in the \"New submissions (pending training)\" table in [my submissions]**add link ??**. Once it is trained, you get a mail, and your submission shows up on the [public leaderboard]**add link ??**.\n",
